# Personal Website 2025

Rebuilt and refactored personal website using better-than-before practices and abstractions.

The stack used is Vite and content is statically served as TypeScript files, with images on AWS. Compilation between CSV data sources and `.ts` files is done using my in-progress, open source but minimal tool [Timburr](https://github.com/andrlime/timburr).
