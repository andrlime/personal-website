# Personal Website 2025

Rebuilt and refactored personal website using better-than-before practices and abstractions.

The stack used is Vite and content is compiled into TypeScript using my in-progress open source tool [Conkeldurr](https://github.com/andrlime/conkeldurr). Images are uploaded to AWS S3.
